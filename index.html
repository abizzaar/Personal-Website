        I'm Abizar. I want to make human experiences with technology more fulfilling through human-centered design.
    </h1>

    <p id="descrOfMe">
        My passions lie at the intersection of technology and design. As a computer science student at Northwestern University, 
        I want to use my engineering skills to shape new experiences with people and technology, bringing people together and 
        increasing the efficiency of products and services. I believe in the human-centered design process because it ensures 
        that my work addresses real needs of people. I find this process exciting because it cultivates a creative work environment 
        and engages my interests in written, visual and interpersonal communication. Having studied in a residential school with people from 
        60 different countries, I also love that the design process is collaborative and pushes me to work with people from diverse backgrounds.
