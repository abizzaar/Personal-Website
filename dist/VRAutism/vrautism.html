                The task was to design an immersive virtual reality experience 
                to replace traditional autism therapy. We had 3 months to design the
                experience with help from professors at Northwestern University. Our client was TherapyOS, a VR healthcare startup.

        <p> The experience has three environments: the drawing environment, the interaction environment, and the dancing environment.

            Each environment is a separate virtual space that you can enter or exit. 
            The design requirements we considered were that the experience be engaging for our user and relevant to sensory therapy.

                The interaction environment is a fantastical atmosphere containing a river with fish, a tree with hanging fruit, 
                and a set of musical strings. The user is guided to perform actions such as cooking fish and chopping wood. Sounds of flowing water and 
                chirping birds play through the headphones.

        <div class="envRight descrProjectRight">
            <h4 id="firstEnvQ" class="environmentQuestions">Why is it engaging for Ethan?</h4>
            <p> We made the environment fantastical because we learned from user testing that Ethan preferred the more 
                surreal Tilt Brush sketches that involved fire and dragons rather than realistic scenes. 
            </p>

            <h4 id="secondEnvQ" class="environmentQuestions">Why is it relevant to sensory therapy?</h4>
            <p> The environment achieves two goals. Firstly, the soothing visuals and music can be therapeutic for hypersensitive people who 
                experience sensory overload. Secondly, moving objects such as the axe and fish can can help simulate tactile interaction, 
                which is greatly valued by people with autism. For example, when we tested an iPad and a cardboard VR headset with one student 
                we learned that he preferred the iPad because it allowed him to interact using his hands.

            <h4 id="firstEnvQ" class="environmentQuestions">Why is it engaging for Ethan?</h4>
            <p> Ethan loves music. When he asked him to rate different VR experiences we tested with him, he rated 5/5 
                for listening to Mr. Brightside and gave everything else a lesser score.

            <h4 id="secondEnvQ" class="environmentQuestions">Why is it relevant to sensory therapy?</h4>
            <p> The bright visuals stimulate the visual system of our user, while the energizing music stimulates the aural system. 
                Such therapy is generally used for people who are hyposensitive.
